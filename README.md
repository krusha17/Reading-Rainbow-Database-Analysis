# Reading-Rainbow-Database-Analysis

**Overview**
This project demonstrates my expertise in designing, implementing, and analyzing a relational database for a fictional bookstore, "Reading Rainbow Bookstore." The database was built to simulate real-world challenges in managing sales, inventory, and employee performance while providing actionable insights through data analysis and visualization.

**Key Features**
Database Design: Created normalized tables with primary and foreign key relationships to ensure data integrity.
Data Manipulation: Executed advanced SQL queries, including joins, unions, and aggregate functions, to extract meaningful insights.
Data Cleaning: Normalized the database to Third Normal Form (3NF) to eliminate redundancy and maintain consistency.
Data Visualization: Designed Tableau dashboards to present sales trends, inventory levels, and employee performance insights.
Real-World Applications: Provided insights into inventory management, sales optimization, and employee performance across multiple branches.

**Project Highlights**
Advanced SQL Queries:
Inner, left, and right joins for data extraction.
Recursive joins to establish hierarchical relationships between branches.
Conditional CASE statements for employee location categorization.
Aggregate functions like AVG and MAX to analyze sales and employee wages.
Updated employee wages and analyzed results using right joins.

**Repository Content**
SQL-Scripts: Contains all SQL scripts for database creation, data insertion, and queries.
Data: Sample data used in the project.
Visualizations`: Tableau dashboards and screenshots of results.

 **Tableau Dashboard**
Explore the interactive dashboards for insights into:
- Sales trends across branches.
- Inventory levels by book and location.
- Employee performance and wage distribution.

**Business Insights:**
Sales performance by branch and book genre.
Inventory levels by branch to identify supply gaps.
Employee performance and wage distribution trends.

**About Me**
I am passionate about leveraging data to drive decision-making. This project reflects my skills in database management, data analysis, and visualization. I am seeking opportunities as a Junior Database Analyst or Data Analyst to bring value to dynamic teams.
